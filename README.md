# N-Queens-Visualization
N-Queens-Visualization is a web page application that uses an HTML canvas to display
a chess board and pieces. The program uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution
for boards of the size determined by the size slider.

# Getting Started
## Installation
Clone the respository and make sure you have Python3 installed on your computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DSSzymanski/N-Queens-Visualization.git
```

# Usage
The program is entirely web based using only Javascript, so opening
"html/NQueens.html" in a web browser will run the web page.

The enitire web page is controlled from the control bar.<br/>

The slider underneath 'Grid Size' changes the size of the board to a NxN size board
with a max of 20x20.
The slider underneath 'Interval Rate' changes how fast the program iterates through
each step of the algorithm.
The solve button starts the backtracking algorithm.
