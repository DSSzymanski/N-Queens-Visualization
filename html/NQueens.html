					<h3><u><b>N-Queens Explained</b></u></h3>
					<h6>Summary</h6>
					<p>
						N-Queens is a chess based puzzle where the goal is traditionally to place 8 Queens on a 8x8 sized chess 
						board without attacking each other. This can be expanded to fit any solution of requiring a number (N) 
						of Queen pieces to be placed on a NxN sized board. The Queen piece can attack in any of the cardinal 
						directions as well as diagonally, so no queen can be placed on the same row, column, or diagonal.
					</p>
					<h6>Using the Display</h6>
					<p>
						At the top of the chess board there are 3 main input controls; the size slider, the interval slider, 
						and the solve button. The size slider will change the size of the board to desired NxN size. Currently 
						the slider ranges from size 1x1 to size 20x20. The interval changes how long the algorithm takes to display 
						the next step between .1 seconds and 2 seconds. The solve button will start the algorithm to solve the 
						N-Queens puzzle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the solve button is clicked and the algorithm is started, the chess board will change and Queen pieces 
						will start to appear on the board. Blue colored Queens on a tile represent that the Queen is currently being 
						tested to make sure that if the Queen is placed there that it won't be being attacked by any other Queen 
						already on the board. Black colored Queens represent expanded Queens where they have already passed testing 
						and are being expanded to see if a solution can be found with that Queen in that position given the rest of 
						the board. A Red queen represents a Queen being deleted due to no solutions existing for that Queen in that 
						position given the rest of the board.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the board size has a valid solution, it will display when the algorithm is finished running. If there is 
						no valid solution for the board size, the board will display as such.
					</p>
					<h6>Algorithm</h6>
					<p>
						Currently the algorithm used to solve this puzzle is a recursive backtracking algorithm. This algorithm searches 
						the board, starting at the left most column and working it's way to the right. The algorithm will start from the 
						top and test each node going down to see if it is a valid node 1 at a time. If the node is valid, it will try 
						expanding the node, placing a queen on the board and moving to the next column.
